# Intro
This directory will contain the scripts to perform our experiments in RQ5; it will also contain the script to compute *FDC*.

The software, SNAP, used to obtain the FLSNs for classes now is only obtained on request. Interested readers can obtain SNAP by emailing us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn).

***Note that this directory now is null. The scripts will be available once our work is officially accepted.***
